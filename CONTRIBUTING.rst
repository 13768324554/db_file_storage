Issues reporting and pull requests are welcome!

For pull requests, please follow the topics below.

Python coding conventions
------------------------------

We try to comply with `pep-8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ wherever possible.
Code from pull requests should do the same.

Tests
------------------------------

The automated tests for the package are in the
`db_file_storage_tests <https://github.com/victor-o-silva/db_file_storage_tests>`_ project.

Before creating a pull request, make sure that all tests still pass, and add/expand tests for
your changes if needed.
